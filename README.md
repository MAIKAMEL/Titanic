# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢ðŸ’»
## Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning models. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of different classifiers to optimize prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) from Kaggle, which contains information on passengers, such as age, sex, fare, and cabin, among other variables. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

## Features
### Data Preprocessing: 
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Visualizing data distribution, relationships, and identifying outliers.
### Modeling: 
Implementing and evaluating different machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost classifiers.
### Performance Metrics: 
Comparing models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Visualizations include heatmaps to show correlations and box plots to identify outliers.
EDA helps in understanding the distribution of data and the relationships between features.

## Modeling
Three machine learning models were built and evaluated:
### Decision Tree Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 76.5%.
### Random Forest Classifier: Improved performance with an accuracy of 79.4%.
### AdaBoost Classifier: Reached an accuracy of 91.3% by leveraging ensemble learning techniques

## Results
### AdaBoost Classifier was the most effective model, achieving the highest accuracy of 91.3%.
#### Confusion matrices and other performance metrics were generated to assess the effectiveness of each model.
